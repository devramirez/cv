# Personal CV Webpage

## Completed Personal Website
This was a fun little project I worked on to get hands-on experience with HTML & CSS. The purpose of this was to showcase what I had learned as a self-taught begineer using online resources such as W3 Schools & MDN Docs. 

## Credits
The materials I used were from [W3 Schools HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) and from [W3 Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
Other materials I used were from [MDN Docs HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/) and [MDN Docs CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/Getting_started)
